  <p>Many UofSC students unintentionally waste energy by leaving lights, laptops, and lab equipment running when not in use. 
    Without an easy way to track energy usage or receive reminders, sustainability often becomes an afterthought, leading to unnecessary energy consumption and higher campus costs.</p>

<p>This affinity diagram shows different ideas for solving energy waste at UofSC. It organizes thoughts into five groups: app features, student motivation, challenges, sustainability impact, and growth opportunities. 
  Each cluster highlights ways to make students more aware of their energy use, overcome possible obstacles, and build a smarter, greener campus.
